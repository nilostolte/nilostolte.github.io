<meta name="description" content="Is your app prepared for tomorrow's resolutions? We offer services and promote vector graphics primitives for the development of interfaces (UI, GUI) on desktops, mobile, web, and embedded systems. The objective is better portability across different platforms and languages, as well as a better solution for different displays resolutions. ">

		<td class="par1">Vector graphics is preferable to pixel graphics in many cases because its image quality is independent of the screen resolution. One of the typical properties of vector graphics is allowing infinite zooming without any quality lost. This property is excellent for GUIs, and using only simple primitives the interfaces can be built practically hardware independent and be portable. Another advantage of using these primitives is that common vector art produced by graphics designers can be used in live interfaces or widgets. This means that interfaces are no longer limited in terms of creativity.</td>

These designs are generally flat, but near realistic designs gain popularity with the advent of digital vector art.

		<td class="par1">Vector graphics really excells in technical illustrations. Below the correspondence between the octree data structure and its representation in space is shown. The space is recursively subdivided in eight equal sized regions called octants. The octants are contiguously stored in arrays with eight positions as shown. If the octant is not empty it points to another array of eight positions and so forth until the last level is reached. Here the coordinates of the voxel nearer to the observer in a space with resolution 32³ are placed in a table to show how their bits are grouped to form an index in the array at each of its five levels. In this way one can convert indexes to coordinates and vice-versa.</td>

		<td class="par1">Vector graphics solves the problem of having different and quite disparate displays and screen resolutions, especially in the near future with ultra high resolutions, because it scales appropriately without losing quality. It becomes the ideal technology to construct GUIs in different programming languages as well as on the web as demonstrated in this website. The simplicity of vector primitives also promotes portability across different platforms, OS, and languages. Since they are quite similar in different environments it is easy to automatically convert from one environment to another.</td>

		<td class="par1">3D graphics and the different 3D frameworks (e.g., OpenGL) are only partially vectorial nowadays. Imagine 2D vector graphics without Bezier curves. That’s what 3D graphics look like because surfaces are defined by polygons. 3D graphics still don’t allow the use of 3D Bezier patches at rendering time. Since 2D Bezier curves are “flattened” as a set of lines to be displayed, it is possible that in the future 3D Bezier patches will be flattened as a set of polygons. 3D surfaces “flatness” should change with depth (levels of detail), whereas in 2D curves it remains constant.</td>
