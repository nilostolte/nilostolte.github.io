               Vector graphics allows styles widely known in graphics design for quite a long time. It is very popular for commercial use, such as in logos, 
               labels, icons, widgets and advertisements. These designs are generally flat, but near realistic designs gain popularity with the advent of 
               digital vector art.
            </p>
            <p>
               In this section I try to concentrate more in the creative portion of the work I have been doing about vector graphics,
               giving some samples, and explaining in few words how they were produced, as well as what have inspired them. I try to
               not be too technical, giving priority to simplicity, easy of use, focusing on smart details, and not drowning into long
               discourses. I'm not a professional designer by any means. My <a href="../about" style="font-family: semibold;">background</a> is mostly 
               <a href="../research/" style="font-family: semibold;">scientific</a>, but all my work is greatly influenced by 
	             graphics design. The goal of this section is to show this influence in my professional life, apart from my technical 
               expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
               I start with some of beer labels I created for my prior brewery, followed by icons, illustrations, designs, etc. In some of these examples
               I explain the steps taken on the creation as well as their inspiration. A more complete list can be found on my 
               <a title="Repository containing many of these and other designs"href="https://github.com/nilostolte/Vector-Art#vector-art" style="font-family: semibold;">Vector Art Github</a>

            <p>
               All these beer labels were designed entirely from scratch, from their names until the last details of the label. Giving attractive and fun names is often a good strategy for maketing a product. Combining with modern, unusual, and attractive artwork can easily boost product acceptability. Here are some samples of the creativity involved in these designs at the list on the left and below:

                 These labels were created using a mixture of techniques and tools. One of these tools, used in the 
                 design above, was <a title="Download portable Inkscape here" 
                 href="https://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/inkscape_portable" 
                 style="font-family: semibold;">Inkscape</a>, a portable (doesn't require installation, it runs from 
                 an USB key or an SD card) open source vector graphics editor. Some other labels were developed using 
                 <a style="font-family: semibold;" title="Download the Postscript manual here" 
                 href="PostScript.pdf">PostScript</a>, a vector graphics language developed by Adobe. The advantage of 
                 PostScript is that vector designs can be typed on a text editor. Once the file is typed it can be 
                 visualized using <a title="Download portable Ghostscript here"

                 style="font-family: semibold;">Ghostscript</a>, an open source Postscript interpreter and visualizer. 
                 Once the design is finished one can generate a PDF file that can be printed or imported. Nowadays, most
                 designs I have been developing are conceived using Illustrator, a vector graphics editor written by Adobe.

            <p>
               Vector graphics really excels in technical illustrations. Below I show a realistic technical illustration of
               a data structure called <a href="https://github.com/nilostolte/Vector-Art/blob/main/README.md#octree" style="font-family: italic;">octree</a>.
               The correspondence between the octree and its representation in space is shown. The space is
               recursively subdivided in eight equal sized regions called octants. These octants are represented and contiguously
               stored in arrays with eight positions as shown on right.
               If the octant is not empty it points to another array of eight positions and so forth until the last level 
               is reached. On the lower right corner, the coordinates of the voxel nearer to the observer in a space with 
               resolution 32³ (the space represented in this octree) are placed in a table to show how their bits are 
               grouped to form an index in the array at each of its five levels. In this way, indexes can be converted to 
               coordinates and vice-versa.
            </p>

               Vector graphics technical illustrations particularly excel in figures for scientific
               articles, books, brochures, and manuals. These formats greatly benefit from the 
               high-quality drawing capabilities, vector fonts, and realistic schematics provided 
               by vector graphics. Moreover, when viewed on screens, these figures can be effortlessly 
               scaled, facilitating detailed examination.

               Below, you'll find an example of a figure illustrating Phong's shading model in
               Computer Graphics, where the caption is integrated within the figure itself. Utilizing
               vector graphics ensures consistent captions across the document by maintaining invisible
               bounding frames with uniform widths around each figure, using a standardized font size, 
               and importing figures at a consistent scale. This approach significantly streamlines the
               layout process during production.

            <h1>Vectorization, Vector Reconstruction, and Vector Reproduction</h1>
            <p>Vector reconstruction and vectorization are popular techniques to reproduce analog or pixelized 
                artwork in vector format. Although vector reconstruction is a kind of vectorization <i>"per se"</i>, 
                it is not equivalent to automatic vectorization, which the term <i>vectorization</i> often means. Both 
                techniques try to reproduce an artwork in vector format but the distinction is that a <i>reconstruction</i> 
                is not done automatically, or at least not automated in the same way. We can use some kind of automation 
                in a reconstruction, but that's generally done manually, mostly using programming. On the other hand, a 
                reconstruction generally starts with some sort of automatic vectorization, with a manual stencil copy,
                or with a total handcrafted <i>reproduction</i> of the original pixelized artwork using the image as a
                template or as a visual guide in a vector graphics editor, using some vector graphics language (such as 
                PostScript or Java's Graphics2D), or a vector graphics file format (such as SVG).
            </p>
            <h2 title="Automatic Vectorization">Automatic Vectorization</h2>
            <p>In order to obtain a high quality automatic vectorization one needs an image with pure colors, that is, 
                with no antialiasing, with no smooth color transitions, and with clear contours. That's obviously extremely 
                difficult to find. For this reason, the images to be vectorized normally have to be 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation" style="font-family: semibold;">segmented</a> first. A simple way to do that is 
                to transform a color image into a <a href="https://grayscale.imageonline.co/" style="font-family: semibold;">grayscale</a> image, and then 
                transforming the grayscale image into a <a href="https://monochrome.imageonline.co/"style="font-family: semibold;">monochrome</a> image. 
                Different results can be obtained by modifying the contrast, brightness and gamma (aka balance) of the grayscale 
                image. In many cases these manipulations produce interesting results, but often they are not at all satisfying.
            </p>
            <p>For example, this image on the left was segmented using these manipulations but it had to be heavily refined by 
		hand to obtain the resulting image on the right.
            </p>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 4% 0 4% 0">
               <img src="yes-roger-dean-cropped.jpg" width="45%" style="margin: 0 2% 0 0;"><img src="yes-roger-dean-seg-cropped.png" width="45%" style="margin: 0 0 0 2%;">
            </div>
            <p>This segmented file was then automatically vectorized using <a href="https://vectorizer.com/" style="font-family: semibold;">vectorizer</a>  
               website and slightly refined by hand. The resulting vectorization is shown below:
            </p>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 3% 0 3% 0"><img src="yes.svg"  width="70%"></div>
            <h2 title="Vector Reconstruction">Vector Reconstruction</h2>
            <p>Below is a perfect example of artwork vector reconstruction. Some elements, such as the facial features, have been
                vectorized and heavily modified by hand. The other elements were all recreated vectorially, either by hand on Illustrator, 
                either procedurally in <a href="reconstruction.html" style="font-family: semibold;">PostScript</a>. In the original analog  
                artwork which is pixelized in the image on the left all the flames are slightly different from each other, while in the vector 
                reproduction on the right they are all identical since the same flame shape was rotated to produce a single closed vector path.
            </p>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 0 0 2% 0"><img src="king-crimson-larks.svg"  width="90%"></div>
            <p>The process to produce this reconstruction is discussed in detail <a href="reconstruction.html" style="font-family: semibold;">here</a>.</p>
            <h2 title="Stencil Copy">Stencil Copy</h2>
            <p>Here's an example of vector reconstruction using <i>stencil copy</i> technique. The image is imported on Illustrator or any 
                other vector graphics editor and the artwork is reconstructed piece by piece manually.

	    <h2 title="Vector Reproduction">Vector Reproduction</h2>
            <p>A vector reproduction is a vector reconstruction where no original element was used to obtain the reproduction besides its original
                visual appearance. The example below is a vector reconstruction departing from an image, but actually starting entirely from
                scratch to generate the vector information. It's a typical example where automatic vectorization doesn't work. Here, PostScript
                was used from start to finish. Since the geometric definition of the original design is self-evident, and there are quite a few
                repeated patterns, PostScript is the ideal tool to automate its generation. The process to obtain this reproduction is discussed in
                detail <a href="reconstruction.html#reproduction" style="font-family: semibold;">here</a>.

            <h1 title="Some icon designs">Icons</h1>
            <p>
               The design of icons is similar to any vector design except that it is expected that the icon will be
               seen with a quite small size, and, thus, it has to be sufficiently thick and not very detailed in
               order to be distiguishable when shown with smaller sizes. This is also applicable to any other objects
               that will appear with a small size.
            </p>
            <p>
               Below is an example of this principle. The design on the right is the original one. It was made by
               first vectorizing a bull skull from a photo, and then retouching it to simplify, refine it and to 
               reinforce symmetry. For example, the eye and other details on one side were mirrowed from the center
               of the skull, but other details were left intentionally asymmetrical to reinforce realism.
            </p>
            <div class="shift-1st-div-left">
               <div style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 70%;">
                  <img src="bull-icon.svg">
               </div>
               <div title="Example of icon design by&#10;thickening lines to create&#10;the icon on the left" style="text-align: center; margin: 2% 0 2% 0">
                  <img src="bull-thick.svg" width="40%" style="margin: 0 2% 0 0;"><img src="bull-thin.svg" width="40%" style="margin: 0 0 0 2%;">
               </div>
            </div>
            <p>
               On the other hand, what is needed in an icon is that its lines must be thick enough to appear 
               when shown in small sizes. The design on the left is obtained by further manipulating the original  
               in order to thicken the lines for this purpose. The result with colors applied is shown on the
               left column.

                  Minimalist icons are quite popular nowadays probably because they allow to represent something in a very simple and 
                  elegant way. This <a title="Repository of over 600 icons" href="icons" style="font-family: semibold;">collection</a>
                  of about 600 icons are examples using wireframe-like designs that can be used in a wide variety of projects. Their
                  versatility is also a strong advantage of this kind of icon design.

            <p>
               The icons symbolizing the contents of all pages in this site as well as in the 
               <a href="../index.html" style="font-family: semibold;">landing page</a> are all
               SVG vector artworks with characters from TinTin comic books. The 
               <a href="../index.html" style="font-family: semibold;">landing page design</a> was inspired from 
               "<a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/vector-illustration-infographic-design-template-with-icons-4-options-steps_11289702.htm" style="font-family: semibold;">4 
               options vector created by rorozoa</a>". Even though nearly the whole original design was a good fit, it was slightly redesigned, some new options were created and a new item was designed from scratch by applying the same technique used in the original artwork. This exemplifies the versatility of vector graphics, allowing to reuse existing vector artworks, and to redesign, to modify, and to add brand new elements to them, while conserving the underlying style.

                  The design on the left was inspired in the icon of the website <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" style="font-family: semibold;">Stackoverflow</a>.
