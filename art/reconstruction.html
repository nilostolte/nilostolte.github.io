            <h1>Vectorization, Vector Reconstruction, and Vector Reproduction</h1>
            <p>Vector reconstruction and vectorization are popular techniques to reproduce analog or pixelized 
                artwork in vector format. Although vector reconstruction is a kind of vectorization <i>"per se"</i>, 
                it is not equivalent to automatic vectorization, which the term <i>vectorization</i> often means. Both 
                techniques try to reproduce an artwork in vector format but the distinction is that a <i>reconstruction</i> 
                is not done automatically, or at least not automated in the same way. We can use some kind of automation 
                in a reconstruction, but that's generally done manually, mostly using programming. On the other hand, a 
                reconstruction generally starts with some sort of automatic vectorization, with a manual stencil copy,
                or with a total handcrafted <i>reproduction</i> of the original pixelized artwork using the image as a
                template or as a visual guide in a vector graphics editor, using some vector graphics language (such as 
                PostScript or Java's Graphics2D), or a vector graphics file format (such as SVG).
            </p>
            <h2 title="Automatic Vectorization">Automatic Vectorization</h2>
            <p>In order to obtain a high quality automatic vectorization one needs an image with pure colors, that is, 
                with no antialiasing, with no smooth color transitions, and with clear contours. That's obviously extremely 
                difficult to find. For this reason, the images to be vectorized normally have to be 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation" style="font-family: semibold;">segmented</a> first. A simple way to do that is 
                to transform a color image into a <a href="https://grayscale.imageonline.co/" style="font-family: semibold;">grayscale</a> image, and then 
                transforming the grayscale image into a <a href="https://monochrome.imageonline.co/"style="font-family: semibold;">monochrome</a> image. 
                Different results can be obtained by modifying the contrast, brightness and gamma (aka balance) of the grayscale 
                image. In many cases these manipulations produce interesting results, but often they are not at all satisfying.
            </p>
            <p>For example, this image on the left was segmented using these manipulations but it had to be heavily refined by 
		hand to obtain the resulting image on the right.
            </p>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 4% 0 4% 0">
               <img src="yes-roger-dean-cropped.jpg" width="45%" style="margin: 0 2% 0 0;"><img src="yes-roger-dean-seg-cropped.png" width="45%" style="margin: 0 0 0 2%;">
            </div>
            <p>This segmented file was then automatically vectorized using <a href="https://vectorizer.com/" style="font-family: semibold;">vectorizer</a>  
               website and slightly refined by hand. The resulting vectorization is shown below:
            </p>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 3% 0 3% 0"><img src="yes.svg"  width="70%"></div>
            <h2 title="Vector Reconstruction">Vector Reconstruction</h2>
            <p>Below is a perfect example of artwork vector reconstruction. Some elements, such as the facial features, have been
                vectorized and heavily modified by hand. The other elements were all recreated vectorially, either by hand on Illustrator, 
                either procedurally in <a href="underdevelopment.txt" style="font-family: semibold;">PostScript</a>. In the original analog  
                artwork which is pixelized in the image on the left all the flames are slightly different from each other, while in the vector 
                reproduction on the right they are all identical since the same flame shape was rotated to produce a single closed vector path.
            </p>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 0 0 2% 0"><img src="king-crimson-larks.svg"  width="90%"></div>
            <p>The process to produce this reconstruction is discussed in detail <a href="underdevelopment.txt" style="font-family: semibold;">here</a>.</p>
            <h2 title="Stencil Copy">Stencil Copy</h2>
            <p>Here's an example of vector reconstruction using <i>stencil copy</i> technique. The image is imported on Illustrator or any 
                other vector graphics editor and the artwork is reconstructed piece by piece manually.
            </p>
            <div title="Example of realistic illustration&#10;from Tintin's comic book using&#10;stencil copy technique" style="text-align: center; margin: 2% 0 2% 0">
               <img src="tintin-rocket-icon.svg" width="40%" style="margin: 0 2% 5% 0;"><img src="tintin-rocket.jpg" width="50%" style="margin: 0 0 0 2%;">
            </div> <a name="reproduction"></a>
	    <h2 title="Vector Reproduction">Vector Reproduction</h2>
            <p>A vector reproduction is a vector reconstruction where no original element was used to obtain the reproduction besides its original
                visual appearance. The example below is a vector reconstruction departing from an image, but actually starting entirely from
                scratch to generate the vector information. It's a typical example where automatic vectorization doesn't work. Here, PostScript
                was used from start to finish. Since the geometric definition of the original design is self-evident, and there are quite a few
                repeated patterns, PostScript is the ideal tool to automate its generation. The process to obtain this reproduction is discussed in
                detail <a href="underdevelopment.txt" style="font-family: semibold;">here</a>.
